# Scalable Microphone Array
This repo containts the complete hardware design for a scalable PDM-to-PCM audio conversion pipeline. It supports:
* Conversion of 32bit/96kHz digital audio
* Scalable to an arbitrary number of microphones
* PL to PS (hardware to software) data offloading through the DMA
* Sound source amplification
